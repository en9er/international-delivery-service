   ```
   Run this command to build and start the Docker containers for running your FastAPI application.
4. Access Your Application:

   Your FastAPI application is now accessible at http://localhost:4000.

5. After first startup:
   create database
   ```
   docker exec -it mysql-container /bin/bash
   ```
   ```
   mysql
